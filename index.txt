Django Best Practices
=====================


This is a living document of best practices in developing and deploying with the `Django Web framework <http://www.djangoproject.com>`__. These should not be seen as the *right* way or the *only* way to work with Django, but instead best practices we've honed after years of working with the framework.

It is a fork of the great `django-reusable-app-docs project <http://github.com/ericholscher/django-reusable-app-docs>`__ started by `Brian Rosner <http://oebfare.com>`__ and `Eric Holscher <http://ericholscher.com>`_ regarding best practices for writing and maintaining reusable Django apps.

.. note:: The source code for this documentation lives on GitHub as `django-best-practices <http://github.com/lincolnloop/django-best-practices>`__ and can be built in a number of formats using `Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org>`__.
