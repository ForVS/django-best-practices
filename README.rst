This project started as a fork of the great `django-reusable-app-docs <http://github.com/ericholscher/django-reusable-app-docs>`_  project started by `Brian Rosner <http://oebfare.com>`__ and `Eric Holscher <http://ericholscher.com>`__ regarding best practices for writing and maintaining reusable Django apps.

We wanted to expand on the idea and create general "best practices" documentation for Django Web development encompassing ideas that are outside the scope of the official documentation. For more information, `read the project announcement <http://lincolnloop.com/blog/2009/apr/9/django-best-practices/>`_.
