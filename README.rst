This is a fork of the great `django-reusable-app-docs`_  project started by `Brian Rosner <http://oebfare.com>`__ and `Eric Holscher <http://ericholscher.com>`__ regarding best practices for writing and maintaining reusable Django apps.

.. _django-reusable-app-docs: http://github.com/ericholscher/django-reusable-app-docs/tree/master

We wanted to expand on the idea and create general "best practices" documentation for Django Web development encompassing ideas that are outside the scope of the official documentation.
