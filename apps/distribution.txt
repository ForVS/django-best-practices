How do I distribute my app?
===========================

Django should be using the standard `Python Package Index
<http://pypi.python.org/pypi>`__ aka PyPI or the Cheese Shop. Eric Holscher wrote
a `tutorial <http://ericholscher.com/blog/2008/aug/6/easily-packing-
and-distributing-django-apps-setupt/>`__ about how to easily package
and upload your app to PyPI. All reusable apps should be uploading to
PyPI.

If you upload your app to PyPI, it is generally a good idea to prefix
your project name with "django-"

Also note, that when below when we refer to the default place for
something as a file, that also means that you can make a directory of
that same name; as per normal python.
