Settings
========

Placed in ``[PROJECT]/settings.py``

Use relative paths for your directories

.. sourcecode:: python

    import os
    DIRNAME = os.path.dirname(__file__)

    MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join(DIRNAME, 'static')
    
Use a ``local_settings.py`` file for machine specific settings and import it at the end of the file.

.. sourcecode:: python

    try:
        from local_settings import *
    except ImportError:   
        pass
